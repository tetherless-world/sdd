Everolimus,accepted,1296,PIK3CA,MUTATION,"Archival tumor samples from 549 patients from the BOLERO-1 and -3 trials were analyzed for alterations in the PI3K pathway using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Sanger sequencing. In the BOLERO trials, patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab, chemotherapy and randomized to receive either everolimus or placebo. In the pooled analysis of both trials, patients with PI3K mutations had longer progression-free survival with everolimus compared to placebo (HR 0.67 95%CI 0.45 to 1.00, P=0.05) whereas patients with PI3K wild type status did not benefit significantly (HR 1.1, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46, P=0.5). The same was found when PI3K mutations, PTEN loss and AKT E17K mutations were combinedly analyzed as hyperactive PI3K pathway. Patients with PI3K hyperactive pathway had a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95%CI 0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) compared to HR 1.19 (95%CI 0.87 to 1.62, P=0.28) in patients with PI3K normal pathway.

Sequencing of 55 HER2 breast cancer samples revealed 25% PIK3CA mutation rate and Kaplan Meier curves showed decreased time to progression for mutant PIK3CA at borderline statistical significance (p=0.052). This was potentially explained by presence of PTEN loss in wild-type PIK3CA sample and combining PTEN loss with PIK3CA mutation resulted in significant differences in time to progression (p=0.007).",Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer,B,Predictive,Supports,Resistance or Non-Response,Somatic Mutation,2

It was found that depletion of Akt3 potentially inhibits the growth of TNBC cell lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, which imply that therapeutic targeting of AKT3 may provide a new treatment option for TNBCs.",Triple-receptor Negative Breast Cancer,E,Predictive,Supports,Sensitivity,N/A,4

Vandetanib induced tumor regression in PDX models with high expression of RET or EGFR. The effect was associated with inhibition of RET/EGFR phosphorylation and MAP kinase pathway and increased necrosis. In a PDX model with no expression of RET nor EGFR, Vandetanib slowed tumor growth without inducing tumor regression. In addition, treatment by Vandetanib decreased expression of murine Vegf receptors and the endothelial marker Cd31 in the four PDX models tested, suggesting inhibition of tumor vascularization.",Estrogen-receptor Negative Breast Cancer,D,Predictive,Supports,Sensitivity,Somatic Mutation,3
